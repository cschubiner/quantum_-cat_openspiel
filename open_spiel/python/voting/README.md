A general implementation of voting rules from computational social choice.

This code implements the voting rules in Voting as Evaluation (VasE):
Lanctot et al. "Evaluating Agents using Social Choice Theory", 2023.
TODO(author5): add arXiv link when it's available.

It also includes a few example uses of running VasE on the Atari datasets
referenced in the paper.
